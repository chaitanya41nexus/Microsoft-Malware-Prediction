# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
IST 718 Big Data Analytics final project.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s Information age, the world relies on advancement in computer technology and the ease it brings to our everyday life. Computers can, however, be attacked digitally using malware which may breach a user or an organization’s privacy and leak sensitive data.
Anti-malware security suites usually have a reactive approach where they detect the security breach after malware has already infected the system. In many cases, the damage is irreversible, and a complete system reset is needed.
While there is no solution that can make a system completely invulnerable to malware attacks, we can, however, analyze how vulnerable a system currently is and what can be done to make it more resistant. We aim to analyze user information (system specific and excluding sensitive information) provided by Microsoft which lists hardware and software configurations of the users against the Windows Defender’s malware detection tag.

## GOALS
- Generate insights to determine configurations that make a system vulnerable/resistant to malware attacks.
- To implement a model which can detect the vulnerability of a system given its configuration as input.
- Predict the combination of OS configurations and anti-malware mechanisms that will help secure a system

## DATASET
We are using a dataset provided by Microsoft on Kaggle containing 83 features and around 8 million instances. It contains 29 categorial variables, 41 numerical variables, and 13 binary variables.
